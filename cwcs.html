        <h1>Conversation Without Common Sense: Experiment on Chatbot-led User Experience Design</h1>
        <p>An undergraduate research about human-chatbot interaction that took a humorous approach on technology transparency and inclusive user-oriented UX</p>
        <h2>&#9830; Research</h2>
        <p>At the end of 2020, although Neuro networks is the future of Chatbots, machines written with information-retrieval systems like AIML still take a large porportion of the market. This unique Structurulistic mechanism generates a few answers that each has a weighted probability according to the algorithm's natural language ubderstanding of the input text. Howevcer, from the users' point of view, only one answer is displayed in the format of the regular human-to-human texting interface. This is simulation makes the subject feel friendly. But when errors occur, for example, when the bot keeps replying the same "sorry. I didn't understand. Did you mean [an irrelevant subject]" it is even more frastratinng because the user does not know which part went wrong.</p>
        <h2>&#9830; Design</h2>
        <p>The initial concept was a digital humanities experimentation with how, in an augmented reality environment, a chatbot can talk like an ion that is omniposcent in our physical world. The the bot does not have to be humanoid to generate intimacy, this difference of quantity abundance could create an illustion of attention. <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/0e3f0d3d-cecb-48cf-b184-3a7cf154b031-5b6c/?fullscreen&hints=off">The demonstration of the first prototype can be found here.</a></p>
        <img class="inline_img" src="img/cwcs00.gif">
        <p>After user research and persona development, the project changed from game making to, within the scope of natural conversation flow, making in the mechanism transparent. The second prototyp is designed accordingly.</p>
        <h2>&#9830; Prototype and User Testing</h2>
        <p>The second prototype utilizes micro-animations and accessible framework to design for a intuitive system. The user tests led to 4 iterations. The first revision changed the back-end AI from a AIML model to DialoGPT from HuggingFace. The second and third tested with low-cost paper prototypes and resulted in the change of color contrast and layout to increase legibility. The last one took <a href="https://lavaz.itch.io/frequency-of-blinking-for-face-symbol">an perception test</a> to find the frequency of blinking that feels the most friendly to average users. It composts of three stages including:
            <ol>
                <li>Introduction and greeting interface which informs the tested subjects</li>
                <li>Control group: a 15-second animation of the symbol appearing, blinking every 3 seconds, and disappearing</li>
                <li>Test group: a 15-second animation of the symbol appearing, blinking (randomly chosen from) for never/ every 7 seconds/ every 2 seconds/ only when at the edge of the display area, and disappearing</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h2>&#9830; Further Applications</h2>
        <p>Because of their unique qualities, conversation with chatbots can take form other than mimicing existing interaction. And design elements can make the processing of such multi-laered information simple. Studies of unconsiciousness and the Avant-Garde animations could be a great source of reference in designing with machines. There Idealty, this design framework can be applied on both generated or retrieved conversational interfaces.</p>
