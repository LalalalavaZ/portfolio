        <h2>&#9830; Concept</h2>
        <p>The experience is realiized in Unity.</p>
        <h2>&#9830; Character</h2>
        <p>Original character which represents the incarnation of accumulated words of remembrance, modeled and animated in Maya. The hair is simulated with nCloth function on multi-triangular surface to produce a feeling of origami (folded paper) floating in breeze.</p>

        <h2>&#9830; UI</h2>
        <p>Many East Asian cultures tradionally believe that the soul of a dead person will revisit its home and body 7 days after its death. The minimalistic UI which calculates the remaining time is mapped to the groups of candles burning down.</p>

        Project Rooms started off by depicting a strange dream, where I woke up finding myself in a room with no window but many doors each leading to different places in the past. Someone told me that I  should go up to the deck, and I'll find out all these places were just rooms inside a boat. When I find the real sky, I will understand the meaning of everything. But the last room I entered was an atrium where flickering figures are silently watching a huge pile of paper burning without a smoke.<br/>
        How could there be an objective “meaning of everything”? I thought. So I decided to build this story into a game, where your “real sky” depends on the choices you made.<br/>
        If you choose to hate, you will find the red end where sky is forbidden; if you choose to love, the open blue sky awaits you; if you regret and confess,  desire too much, or just enjoy being in a room, the white end with paper sky could possibly be where you go.<br/>
        In Project Rooms, you will find out, at a certain point, that you are already dead, and will be lingering in this peculiar space in the first 7 days after death. You will constantly hear people mentioning the deck, the red room, and the atrium. The reason you dead and the place end up with at the last day will be  determined by your own choice of speech and behavior. 
        Time reminder UI is designed as burning down candles. 3 groups each indicates the first day, 6th day, and last day; the 3 candles in each group shows time at the beginning of the day, 10am, and 12pm.
