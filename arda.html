            <!-- interest -->
            I'm interested in chemistry and playful experience. How chemistry suggests a certain set of building blocks and universal rules which allowed much more diversity that build up our world. I want to use playful experience to bring this abstraction close to us.

            <h1>Arda: Conversation Without Common Sense</h1>
            <p>Arda is a world composed of various talking chemical particles who does not have much common sense toward human society. This project aims to generate a referential model of thinking or value set based on chemical reactions.</p>

            <p>The trend in Machine Learning development often is to mimic natural human cognition and behavior. However, with humans manipulating a model's data input, the result prejudices. What would a comparatively objective perspective feel like? If machines have their own thought, ignoring all the "bad common sense" we built up through aging, would they equally view all the carbon-based intellectual beings called "human"? Would it help us better understand what made up the presets in our daily life? While common chatbots try to make fluent conversation with humans, Project Arda will generate values from chemical property data, grammar from equations, and chat response contents from chemical reaction types. Combining ideas in chemistry, the elements that compose the entire physical world we live in, with the method of machine learning, a tool which proficients at producing expected, non-common-sense results, these chatbots may demonstrate an interesting new way of seeing the world.</p>
            <p>how would elements react to events in human society?</p>
